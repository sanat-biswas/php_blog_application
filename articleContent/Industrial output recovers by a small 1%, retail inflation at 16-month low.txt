On the other hand, the consumer price index (CPI)-based inflation rate fell for the third straight month to 4.06 per cent in January as food inflation, pulled down by deflation in vegetables, drastically declined. The inflation rate stood at 4.59 per cent in December and a high base of 7.59 per cent in January 2020.</p>

Industrial activity has posted growth in only three months in the current financial so far. The IIP had turned positive in September after a gap of six months on the back of festival season demand, indicating normalcy in economic activity after months of disruption caused by Covid-19. &ldquo;While the Indian industrial sector expectedly returned to a growth in December 2020, the pace was tepid at 1.0 per cent, and trailed our expectations (+2.2%). Even as many lead indicators have displayed a robust pace of expansion in the recent months, the subdued 1.0 per cent growth of the IIP in Q3 FY2021 suggests that the recovery in the broader economy remains relatively measured,&rdquo; said Aditi Nayar, principal economist, ICRA Ratings. The economy contracted 23.9 per cent in the first quarter and 7.5 per cent in the second quarter. It is officially projected to decline 7.7 per cent in the current financial year. She expected the pace of industrial growth to inch up in January 2021.</p>
